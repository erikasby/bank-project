We know Google's obsession with creating different frameworks and launching a few programming languages. Dart was one of the programming languages launched by Google which was object-oriented and a web-based programming language.

Dart programming language didn't gain a huge response from the developers and hence it never got the position of mainstream programming language. Many programmers prefer C++ and JavaScript over Dart due to their strong background.

One programming language named GO gained quite impressive among developers and GO. GO or GoLang was statically typed and explicit. It was a general-purpose programming language that was similar to the C programming language.

Now Google is all set to launch a new programming language called Carbon programming language.

## Carbon Programming Language Launch

Recently, CPP north event 2022 was held and basically, it is an event where many developers come together to discuss future developments of C++. So, in this event, a Googler named Chandler Carruth introduced developers to a new programming language called Carbon.

The carbon programming language was announced as an experimental language that could be a successor to the C++ programming language.

Chandler Carruth who is also the technical lead for Google programming language also told us that they would be starting this experimental work with the C++ community.

## Build up

This launch was very interesting and the announcement of the Carbon programming language was also done through a comparison of mainstream programming languages with its successors.

As we know, C++ is a successor of C. TypeScript is a Successor of JavaScript. Swift is a successor of Objective C. Kotlin is a successor of Java. But who is the successor of C++?

Is it Rust? Yes, we can call Rust pretty much a successor of C++ but it is very hard for users to learn and is in the very early stage of its development. Hence, it is too early for Rust to be called a successor of C++ and it is pretty difficult for Rust to be a successor for a powerful language like C++.

With a huge amount of developers who are currently programming in C++, a successor is required to overcome the needs of modern programming problems. Therefore, C++ currently doesn't have a well-defined successor, and Carbon could possibly be a successor of C++.
